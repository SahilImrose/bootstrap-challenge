Barring hardware failure, many of these devices may still have years of use ahead of them if power users can install any regular GNU/Linux distribution on them. In fact, a recent development has been brought to our attention which will help pave the way for the prolonged life of these old iPhone devices.

                    One developer by the name of “newhacker1746” on Reddit is taking the challenge of turning the iPhone 7 into a Linux-powered smartphone. Besides booting the ARM64 build of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on an iPhone 7, the developer also managed to run the full-fledged graphical shell of the GNOME desktop environment on the device.</p>
